    <h2>The Perfect Combination of Culinary Delight and Innuendo</h2>

      <p>
        What's better than Glazed Pumpkin Donuts?  The holiday season, no wait, I reversed that.  What's better than the holiday season?  Glazed Pump- there's no point, I already buried the lede.  But if you want to condense all the pleasures of October, November and December into one delicious treat, might I suggest to you the <em>Glazed.  Pumpkin.  Donut.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't go anywhere, let me try a different introduction.  What's better than prominent 90's rap group Dogg Pound Gangsters or the DPG?  How about <em>GPD</em>, Glazed Pumpkin Donuts that is.  That was a bit of a stretch, anyway here's how you make them . . . the donuts, not the rap group.
