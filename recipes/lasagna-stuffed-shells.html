    <h2>The Perfect Family Dish in the Perfect Portions</h2>

      <p>A perfect blend of ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, and ground beef round out this family friendly recipe.  Most lasagnas are not family friendly as they have been known to pull out a switchblade on your children and as everyone is running around, screaming "I didn't know Italian food was sentient!" and "Where did it get a switchblade?!" you'll be glad you made your lasagna with shells.  Which are after all a defensive item.  No knife needed, not even to portion out an individual serving.  Lasagna-Stuffed Shells for the win!</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add <strong>1/2 the Ground Beef</strong>, season with <strong>Pepper</strong> and a liberal <strong>pinch of Salt</strong>.  Cook for approx. 5 minutes until beef is seared and crumbly.  Remove beef, repeat for remainder, then set all meat aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower heat to medium-low.  Add <strong>1 tbsp of Olive Oil</strong> and <strong>Chopped Onion</strong>.  Saute approx. 2 minutes or until aromatic.  Add <strong>Tomato Paste</strong> and <strong>Oregano</strong>, then add <strong>Ground Beef</strong> and <strong>Tomato Sauce: 1 can</strong>.  Stir to combine and reduce to a simmer.  Add <strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>Pepper</strong> to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to <b>375</b>&#x2109/<b>190</b>&#x2103.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add <strong>Shells</strong> and cook for approx. 9 minutes.  Shells should be tender yet firm to the bite.  Strain. <em>*note: pasta water can be used later to add to the sauce.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining <strong>tbsp of Olive Oil</strong> in another pan over medium heat, add <strong>Garlic</strong>.  Saute until lightly golden.  Transfer garlic to mixing bowl with <strong>Ricotta, Mozzarella, Spinach, Basil, and Lemon Zest & Juice</strong>.  Add <strong>Salt</strong> to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour remaining <strong>Tomato Sauce</strong> in a 9x13-inch baking dish.  Spoon cheese mixture into shells, followed by meat.  Place shell into sauce when stuffed, top with <strong>Parmesan Cheese</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in preheated oven approx. 25 - 30 minutes or until shells are hot in the center and the mozzarella cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove dish from oven and let cool until ready to serve.  Serve and enjoy knowing you've escaped the tyranny of non-friendly lasagna and the horrors they would inflict upon your loved ones in their zealous quest for ever-growing control over the minds of the people.
