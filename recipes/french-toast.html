    <h2>A Breakfast Food You'll Never Quit</h2>

      <p>
        Looking for a delicious meal you can surrender to at any time of day?  Well if we're speaking about surrendering then it's got to be something <em>French</em>, it's French Toast.  Was that last sentence racist?  No, it was xenophobic and nobody cares about xenophobia in June of 2022, but they probably will if/when I ever get successful and then I'll release an insincere apology.  Let's make some French Toast!
